## Collaborators / Contributors:

* @frannyaimee Frances Renneboog


## Context: 

This is simply a sample 404 page that we created in BeCode. It was one of the first exercises given to us by the coaches. This is the page that would load if someone using my site were to get lost or try to reach a link that doesn't exist I chose a background image of the forest with an opacity layer of it, so that I could use the terms "You took a wrong turn somewhere"
The link at the top of the page leads the user back to my GitHub page
There is a little bit of animation on the text as it loads and comes into screen
There is also animation on the link at the top of the page that leads back to my GitHub-- the animation is simply a line that appears.

## Installation:

No installation needed. All of the code for this project was written using Sublime Text editor. The entire website was written using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
